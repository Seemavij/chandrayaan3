            <h3>India could become the first nation to land a spacecraft on the moon’s south pole, days after a Russian
                probe crashed in the same region – an historic moment for the world’s most populous nation, as it
                rapidly closes in on milestones set by global space powers.

            </h3>

            <h4> Chandrayaan-3, which means “Mooncraft” in Sanskrit, is scheduled to touch down shortly after 6pm India
                time (12:30 GMT) on Wednesday near the little-explored lunar south pole.

                Sivan added that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had made corrections after a failure four
                years ago, when scientists lost contact with the previous lunar module moments before its slated
                landing.

                “Chandrayaan-3 is going to go with more ruggedness,” he said. “We have confidence, and we expect that
                everything will go smoothly.”

                “And this time, they have had all the fail-safe mechanisms put into it, they have learnt the right
                lessons and I am very sure … we will have a very good.</h4>

            The mission was launched nearly six weeks ago in front of thousands of cheering spectators, but took much
            longer to reach the moon than those of the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s, which arrived in a matter
            of days.

            <h3> Experts say India can keep costs low by copying and adapting existing space technology, and thanks to
                an abundance of highly skilled engineers who earn a fraction of their foreign counterparts’ wages. </h3>
